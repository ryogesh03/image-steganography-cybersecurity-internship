# Image Steganography using LSB (Cybersecurity Internship Project)

## Overview
This repository contains the documentation and presentation of my cybersecurity internship project focused on **hiding secret text inside digital images** using **Least Significant Bit (LSB) image steganography** implemented with Python.

The objective of the project was to understand how data can be concealed within images for secure communication and to study its relevance, advantages, and risks in cybersecurity.

## Project Objective
- To implement image steganography for hiding textual information inside images
- To study LSB-based data embedding and extraction techniques
- To understand real-world cybersecurity use cases and ethical considerations

## Methodology (High Level)
- RGB image processing
- Conversion of text data into binary format
- Embedding binary data into image pixels using LSB manipulation
- Extraction of hidden data from the encoded image

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pillow (Image Processing)
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Kali Linux (learning environment)
- VS Code

## Contents of This Repository
- `report/`  
  Contains the detailed internship project report explaining concepts, methodology, implementation, and results.
